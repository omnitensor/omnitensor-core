# OmniTensor Core

## Overview

The OmniTensor Core is the foundational component of the OmniTensor ecosystem, implementing the core blockchain functionality and consensus mechanism. This module is responsible for maintaining the network's state, processing transactions, and coordinating with other nodes in the network.

## Key Features

- Dual-layer architecture (L1 EVM Chain and OmniChain)
- DualProof consensus mechanism (PoW + PoS hybrid)
- High-performance block processing and state management
- Secure P2P networking and node discovery
- Integration with AI compute nodes

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.55.0 or later
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later
- CUDA Toolkit 11.0 or later (for GPU support)
